### Description

As a Data Analyst at Digital Echoes, I led a team of five talented analysts on a project focused on analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) for the company's website. Our objective was to provide valuable recommendations to increase the amount of users and new users visiting the website which in turn reduces the bounce rate on the website. We followed a structured approach, including data extraction, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and give recommendations.


### Skills
  
The project required the following skills:
- Data extraction and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- SQL for data analysis
- Power BI for creating intuitive dashboards
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
- Team management and collaboration



### Technology

The following technologies were used in this project:
- Microsoft Excel: Excel was used to store and manage the sales data, and perform preliminary data analysis.
- SQL Server: SQL Server was utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation to prepare the data for analysis.
- Power BI: Power BI was used for creating a relationship between the datasets, data visualization and presentation, creating interactive and informative dashboards.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Prioritize High-Performing Channels: Focus efforts on Direct, Social, and Organic Search, as they generated the highest users and new users. Expand strategies such as optimized SEO content, targeted ads, and consistent social media engagement.

- Address High Bounce Rates: Investigate reasons for the 56.29% average bounce rate. Revise landing page content to ensure relevance and improve user experience. Implement A/B testing for content and design changes.

- Improve Underperforming Channels: For channels with the least sessions (Email, Paid Search, and Referral), analyze their audience segmentation and messaging strategy. Enhance call-to-action content and explore retargeting campaigns to boost engagement.

- Capitalize on Seasonal Trends: Leverage insights from the 115.64% session growth in February. Align major campaigns or promotions with similar high-traffic periods while addressing the -7.86% drop in March to maintain momentum.

- Optimize Resource Allocation: Channels like Paid Search and Referral, which show low session counts and high bounce rates, may require reallocation of marketing budget toward more effective channels (e.g., Social).

By implementing these recommendations, Digital Echoes can optimize their advertising strategies, improve ad performance, and stay ahead in the competitive landscape.
