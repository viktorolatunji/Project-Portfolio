### Description

As a Data Analyst at Digital Echoes, I led a team of five talented analysts on a project focused on analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) for the company's website. Our objective was to provide valuable recommendations to increase the amount of users and new users visiting the website which in turn reduces the bounce rate on the website. We followed a structured approach, including data extraction, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and give recommendations.


### Skills
  
The project required the following skills:
- Data extraction and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- SQL for data analysis
- Power BI for creating intuitive dashboards
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
- Team management and collaboration



### Technology

The following technologies were used in this project:
- Microsoft Excel: Excel was used to store and manage the sales data, and perform preliminary data analysis.
- SQL Server: SQL Server was utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation to prepare the data for analysis.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Monitor Ad Performance: Regularly track ad performance metrics and adjust budget allocation based on return on investment (ROI). Use data-driven insights to make informed decisions and optimize the campaign over time.

- Utilize Ad Platform Insights: Leverage analytics and insights provided by the advertising platforms to better understand the campaign's performance. Utilize data on ad impressions, click-through rates, and engagement to identify trends, make informed decisions, and optimize the campaign strategy accordingly.

- Analyze the January Results (Facebook likes and Instagram followers): Examine the strategies and targeting used in January to understand what resonated well with the audience and contributed to positive results in terms of engagement.

- Evaluate the April Surge: Assess the factors that led to a significant surge of 198.74% in ad spend from March to April. Analyze the corresponding performance metrics to understand the impact of the increased ad spend and identify successful tactics for future campaigns.

- Track Market Trends: Stay updated with market trends and industry developments related to the advertised product or service. Analyze how these trends may influence the target audience's behavior or preferences and adjust the ad campaign accordingly to maximize engagement.

By implementing these recommendations, Digital Echoes can optimize their advertising strategies, improve ad performance, and stay ahead in the competitive landscape.
